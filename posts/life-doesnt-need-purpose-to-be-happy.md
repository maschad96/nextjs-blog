Every self-help book we read will tell us about living a meaningful life and living with purpose. Still, none of these books won't ever tell us that it's terrific to be content with ourselves, only ourselves, without a sense of anything other than yourself and gratitude.

Some might call this selfish. I don't think humility needs to be selfless - humility can be full of yourself, full of others, or full of surroundings.

A book observing Stoicism that I've recently read, "Ego Is The Enemy," by Ryan Holiday, dives deep on living with purpose, teaches to live with purpose - not passion. While I enjoy the book and agree with a lot of its contents, I don't think people should stress about choosing purpose over passion, or vice versa.

I want to live each moment to its fullest, without 'fullest' having any implied meaning or obligation.

A quote on the topic that made me smile today:

> "I heard this story about a fish. He swims up to an older fish and says: "I'm trying to find this thing they call the ocean." "The ocean?" the older fish says, "that's what you're in right now." "This," says the young fish, "this is water. What I want is the ocean!" - Dorothea in **[Soul](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948372/)**.

To put it simply - choosing joy before purpose and method seem effective; it seems to keep us present and in the moment.

The benefits we work for come as a side effect to choosing life. People are more productive and sociable when they are happy and living each moment fully, not when they choose purpose and self-criticism before smiles and laughter.
