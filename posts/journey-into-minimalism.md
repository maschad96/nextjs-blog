When I moved to Florida on Christmas, I purged almost all of my possessions. Seriously, almost everything.

At first, I considered it a culmination of losses - now, after pulling the trigger, I think only benefits came from it.

There are a plethora of things I owned that didn't bring as much value to my life as I thought they would:

-   a photo backdrop
-   standing Desk
-   $400 chair
-   Yeti microphone
-   LED ring light
-   IKEA furniture for the company I never had
-   IKEA rugs
-   IKEA chest of drawers containing nothing but items that didn't provide value
-   road bike that I never rode
-   clothes that didn't fit well or look good
-   instant pot that didn't get used
-   blender that didn't get used
-   car
-   plenty of other shit that I can't remember

I also had collected home-workout equipment since my apartment building gym wasn't open due to lockdown measures. I didn't feel like leaving and going on a trip to the gym every day. Home gyms can take up quite a bit of space in a studio apartment.

## The Move

When I packed my bags, I left with:

-   [clothes iron](https://amzn.to/2MkMSr2)
-   [lav microphone](https://amzn.to/3n8Qf0X)
-   [seat cushion](https://amzn.to/3pLDag2)
-   [stick vacuum](https://amzn.to/3hACPd7)
-   4 pairs of pants
-   7 shirts
-   camera
-   headphones
-   hygiene essentials
-   two mechanical keyboards (still excessive, but I enjoy these)
-   personal laptop
-   work laptop

I fit everything into two suitcases.

I fell into the trap of purchasing to fill tiny pockets of required dopamine rather than living life itself.

Moving forward, I will actively ask, "does this bring me value," before I waste my space, time, and energy.
